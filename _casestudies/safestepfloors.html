  <h4>The Beginning</h4>
  <p>To begin working on building the Safestep Floors brand, we first looked towards the competition to see what they were offering different from what Safestep Floors is offering. Upon reviewing these competitors, we were able to come up with a game plan and an uproach to reaching the customer. The website is not the place to win people over, but simply be a place of reference, and a place to solidify the brand. The website needs to be simple and give the numbers that the COF of a potential client's floor should be.</p>

  <h4>The Approach</h4>
  <p>The approach for the company reguarding gaining clients is much more personal e.g. phone calls or face to face meetings. To aid Safestep Floors in these meetings, a brochure is needed. This print work needs to represent the brand and provide customers with all of the essential information they need on the service, product, and outcome.</p>
