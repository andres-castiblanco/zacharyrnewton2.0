  <!--<h4>The Beginning</h4>
  <p>To start this rebrand, the first thing that had to be done was discuss the audience, the goals, and the emotion of the site that we wanted to make any visitor feel. We also needed to get any ideas out on paper as soon as possible.
  <br><br><b>Who is the audience?</b><br>Small Companies, Startups, Companies looking for their brand or a rebrand, Company/persons needing a digital presence.
  <br><br><b>What are the goals of the website?</b><br>Should be a place to send potential clients so they can gain more information, be a place to build an audience, to show current products/projects that are being worked on.
  <br><br><b>What tone or emotion is trying to be portrayed on the website?</b><br>Fun, Modern, Minimalistic, and calm. Content should be the fun of the website.
  <br><br>After getting those three large questions answered, we started to plan what some of the content would be on the website. We came up with a site map that simply contained three main pages: Homepage, Blog, and Case Studies.</p>
